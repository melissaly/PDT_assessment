Thank you for taking the time to assess my test; I hope it covers all the bases you were looking for. I acknowledge that the project might have been excessive with its testing and features; the simplicity and context of this task may not have warranted such thoroughness. However, I wanted to demonstrate my commitment to correctness and quality as I imagine PDT Partners does not have much room for error. 

This was a fun exercise. I enjoyed taking my time to consider different aspects of a program the way I was able to do with the small task, and I hope it interests you.

Thank you,
Melissa Ly
